# 2Do

### Motivation
Creating a To-do list helps reduce stress and makes us feel more relaxed. We get a feeling of being in control of our life and actions. Also, crossing items off your to-do list gives you a sense of accomplishment and progress. This helps you motivate yourself and keep going when things get tough.

### Problem statement
Social media and other easily accessible online distractions make it hard for us to stay focused on our tasks and make it difficult for us to do our work efficiently.
Also, constantly switching between tasks may give us the false feeling that we are being productive when we are, in fact, not. It’s more important for us to prioritize tasks and work on those that are most important, rather than focusing on deleting small items from our to-do list just for the sake of appearances.

### Features
* Thoughtful User Experience
* Different iOS Colour Schemes
* Amazing Subtle Animation
* Swipe feature to easily delete a list item
* Set the priority of the task

### Future Goals
I will add a widget feature to view your task from home screen without opening the app. Along with this, a swipe feature will be embedded to cross an item after completing it. 

#### Instructions to run the project locally
